# Backend Project

This is a backend API project built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **TypeScript**, **MongoDB**, and **SQL**. It is designed to help beginners understand the structure and concepts of backend development with practical tasks they can work on to sharpen their skills.

This project is built with simplicity and clarity in mind. You can follow along with the code and explore:

--How REST APIs work with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).

--How to set up and use a MongoDB NoSQL database with Mongoose.

--How to set up and use SQL databases for relational data.

--How to use an ORM (like Sequelize or Knex.js) to interact with an SQL database.

--How to structure a Node.js backend application.

--Best practices for organizing routes, controllers, and models.
