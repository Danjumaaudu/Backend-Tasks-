# Backend Playground (TypeScript)

This repo contains my learning projects and mini tasks as I explore backend development using Node.js, Express, and TypeScript.

## Contents

- `auth-flow/` - Basic authentication with JWT and user login/register flow.
- `jwt-refresh-flow/` - Refresh token implementation with access & refresh tokens.
- `mongo-crud/` - CRUD APIs using MongoDB and Mongoose with TypeScript.
- `prisma-basics/` - Setting up Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL or SQLite.

Each folder is a standalone backend task/project with its own setup.

## How to Use

1. `cd` into the task folder.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Start dev server with `npm run dev`.
